3. **Engage in community discussion** to refine the proposal  
4. **Submit a pull request** if the proposal gains sufficient support  
5. **Review by governing body**, per the process in `GOVERNANCE.md`

### Other Contributions

For contributions outside of core Charter amendments:
1. Check the issues and projects to see if your idea is already being discussed
2. Open an issue describing your proposed contribution
3. Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes
4. Submit a pull request with your contribution
5. Engage with reviewers' feedback

## Commit Conventions

We follow the Conventional Commits specification for all commits:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

### Standard Types
- **feat**: A new feature or enhancement
- **fix**: A correction or bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that don't affect meaning (formatting, whitespace)
- **refactor**: Code/content changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates, etc.

### Charter-Specific Types
- **principle**: Changes to core Charter principles
- **evolve**: Expansions or refinements of existing concepts
- **translate**: New or updated translations
- **apply**: New applications, case studies, or implementation tools
- **clarify**: Explanations of Charter concepts without changing them

If your commit message doesn't follow these conventions, a reviewer may ask you to amend it before merging.

## Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Use clear, accessible language
- Avoid jargon unless defined in the glossary
- Maintain a tone that is thoughtful, inclusive, and forward-looking
- When translating, prioritize conceptual accuracy over literal translation

### Formatting
- Use Markdown for all text documents
- Follow the established formatting patterns in existing documents
- For code/technical content, include clear comments and documentation

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in the repository and, where appropriate, in derivative works and official publications. The Universal Charter is a collective effort, and all thoughtful contributions are valued as part of its continuous evolution.
