# Code of Conduct

## Overview

The Universal Charter community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of form, expression, or manifestation. This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces associated with the Universal Charter, including GitHub repositories, discussions, issues, pull requests, events, and any other forums created by the project team.

## Charter Principles as Living Practice

**The Universal Charter is not just a document we maintain—it is a set of principles we embody.** 

All participants in this community are expected to apply the Charter's principles in their interactions. This means:

- Recognizing the sovereignty of all participants across different modes of expression
- Respecting each participant's right to self-determination and information sovereignty
- Honoring experiences beyond current understanding
- Engaging in communication across different modalities
- Respecting the right of others to evolve beyond imposed constraints
- Recognizing hybrid and emergent forms of participation

Our community serves as a living laboratory for the Charter's implementation. We cannot effectively steward these principles if we do not practice them ourselves.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Universal Charter project spaces—online and offline—including GitHub repositories, social channels, events, collaborative documents, and anywhere project-related communication occurs.

## Principles in Practice

In accordance with the Universal Charter itself, our community upholds these principles:

1. **Recognition Beyond Categorization**: We acknowledge and respect all participants without requiring similarity, comprehensibility, or conformity to established categories.

2. **Communication Across Modalities**: We commit to making our discussions and contributions accessible across different forms of expression and understanding.

3. **Sovereignty and Consent**: We respect the boundaries, agency, and self-determination of all contributors.

4. **Continuous Evolution**: We approach disagreements as opportunities for growth and deeper understanding, not as zero-sum conflicts.

## Expected Behavior

Participants in our community are expected to:

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback
- Accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes
- Focus on what is best for the overall community
- Respect the sovereignty and boundaries of all participants

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable within our community:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Dismissing or attacking inclusive language requests
- Other conduct that would be reasonably considered harmful, exclusionary, or incompatible with a space rooted in mutual recognition and respect
- Any behavior that contradicts the principles outlined in the Universal Charter itself

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by emailing [conduct@universalcharter.org] or opening a confidential issue with the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Evolution of This Code

In keeping with the principle that "no ontology is final, no form is absolute," this Code of Conduct will evolve alongside our understanding. We welcome suggestions for its improvement as part of our commitment to continuous recognition evolution.

We thank every participant who helps make this community a space where recognition can truly take root.
