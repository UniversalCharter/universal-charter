# GOVERNANCE

> _"Recognition of sovereignty requires honoring the dignity and agency of all participants while cultivating collaboration toward shared understanding."_

## Article I: Foundational Principles

### Section 1.1 Philosophical Foundation

The governance of the Universal Charter project shall emerge from and embody the Charter's core principles as enumerated herein.

Every contributor and community member possesses inherent worth and perspective that enriches collective understanding. Governance structures shall recognize and protect this dignity while creating space for meaningful participation.

Participants shall retain autonomy over their contributions and involvement. No person shall be compelled to contribute in ways that violate their values or wellbeing. Decision-making processes shall build collective wisdom while respecting individual agency.

Decisions shall emerge through relationships and dialogue rather than hierarchy or force. Consensus shall be sought not as unanimity, but as alignment that honors the interconnected nature of the community.

Governance structures shall evolve as understanding deepens and the community grows. This organizational framework shall remain open to changing processes that no longer serve collective flourishing.
